        <h2> What To Expect </h2>
        <p id="info"> When you visit, expect to find open-minded, Bible-based teaching, and simple, God-honoring, Christ-centered, worship. 
        Our sincere desire is to praise God in spirit and truth (John 4:24) while encouraging one another (1 Cor. 14:26).   </p>
        
        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>The Bible class hour on both Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings provides a wonderful opportunity to discuss the Bible and 
        Bible-related topics.  Children can expect to have a lot of fun learning Bible lessons with songs, pictures, crafts, and sometimes 
        videos.  Adults can expect to find open, Bible-based discussions where truth is upheld while respecting differing views. </p>
        
        <h3>Singing</h3>
        <p>Song books are located in the racks in each pew (bench seat). Each song in the book has a corresponding number that the song 
        leader will call out prior to singing.  We sing a capella, and encourage everyone to participate (Col. 3:16).</p>
        
        <h3>Prayer</h3>
        <p>Several men of the congregation will be called upon to lead prayers during the service (1 Tim. 2:8).  Through prayer we are able 
        to praise, honor, petition, and give thanks to God (Phil. 4:6).</p>
        
        <h3>The Lord's Supper</h3>
        <p>The Lord's Supper (communion) is a memorial instituted by Jesus on the night of His betrayal (Matt. 26:26-29), observed in memory 
        of His death (1 Cor. 11:24-25).  At this time we eat unleavened bread (symbolizing His body) and grape juice (symbolizing His blood). 
        During this portion of the service, trays containing the bread will be passed, followed by trays of small cups containing the juice.</p>
        
        <p> We partake of the Lord's Supper every Sunday, as it holds special significance regarding the resurrection of Jesus (Matt. 28), 
        and the establishment of his church (Acts 2:1ff).</p>
        
        <h3>Collection</h3>
        <p> A collection is taken every Sunday in order to support the work of the church. This is an opportunity to give back a portion of 
        what we have been given by God (2 Cor. 9:7).  After the Lord's Supper, collection plates will be passed to receive these voluntary 
        offerings. Visitors are not expected to give, so feel free to pass the plate on to the next person.</p>
        
        <h3>Preaching</h3>
        <p>During the worship service, expect to hear a practical, easy-to-understand sermon rooted in Scripture.  We currently have no full-time 
        preacher, so several of us share the preaching duties.</p>
