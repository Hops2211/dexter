        <h2> What We Believe </h2>
        <p id="info"> About God…There is only one true God, the Creator of all life and Supreme Ruler of the universe.
        He is eternal and reveals Himself to us in three distinct and divine personalities: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ),
        and God the Holy Spirit. God wants nothing more than to have a loving, personal relationship with each of us that will last
        throughout eternity. </p>

        <p id="verses" >Genesis 1:26-27; Deuteronomy 6:4; Job 38:1-41:34; Matthew 3:13-17; John 3:16; Romans 1:19,20; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 4:6</p>

        <p>About Jesus Christ…Jesus Christ is the one and only Son of God. Co-equal with God the Father and God the Spirit,
        He came to earth and was both fully man and fully divine. He revealed to us who God is through His miraculous acts, sinless life,
        and life-changing teachings. He died on the cross, taking the sins of all mankind upon Himself, and paying the penalty that our sins deserve.
        After three days, He rose from the grave and ascended to Heaven where He sits at the right hand of God.</p>

        <p  id="verses">Matthew 1:22-23; John 1:1,14,18; Acts 10:37-43; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Ephesians 2:4-8; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:15-21; Hebrews 1:1-3</p>

        <p>About the Holy Spirit…The Holy Spirit is co-equal with God the Father and God the Son. He lives in each Christian as a Helper and Guide.
        He helps Christians to do what is right, provides strength to serve Jesus, and direction for living life God’s way. </p>

        <p  id="verses"> John 14:16-17; John 16:7-13; Acts 2:38; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Ephesians 3:16-20; Ephesians 5:18 </p>

        <p> About the Bible…The Bible is God’s written Word, written by divinely inspired men to record the values and principles that Christian lives
        should be based on. The Word of God is accurate, reliable and trustworthy. It tells us who God is, why He loves us, and what His plans are for us.
        We accept the Bible as the timeless and ultimate authority and standard for living our lives according to God’s will.</p>

        <p  id="verses">Psalm 19:7-11; Psalm 119:105, 160; John 17:17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21</p>
